# Mini-Batch Shuffling Strategies for Multi-class Imbalanced Classification
This repository contains the code for mini-batch shuffling strategies for multi-class imbalanced classification. The code provides the following functions:

- random shuffling strategy code
- different strategies for multi-class imbalanced classification
  
## Installation Requirements
The basic requirement for using the files is a Python 3.8.19 environment with PyTorch 2.3.0

## Source Files
Here is a brief description of the files and folder content:

- random_shuffling.py: random shuffling for multi-class imbalanced classification
- class_with_imbalance.py: proposed strategy for multi-class imbalanced classification

## Running the code
To generate the dataset, run all .py files to implement different strategies for multi-class imbalanced classification.

## Developer Team
The code was developed by Yuwei Mao from the [CUCIS](http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/) group at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northwestern University.
